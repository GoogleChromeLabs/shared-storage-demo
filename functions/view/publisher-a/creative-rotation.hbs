      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>
        An advertiser may want to show different ads of the same campaign to the user to increase effectiveness of the
        ads.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this demo, the creative can be rotated with different strategies. In sequential rotation, creatives A, B and
        C are shown one after another. In even distribution, the creative is selected at random where each creative has
        an equal chance of being chosen. In weighted distribution, some creatives can be weighted to be chosen more
        often than another creative.
